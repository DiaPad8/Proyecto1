        <p>
            We never got it right
            Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
            Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
            'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
            And what's the point in hidin'?
            Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
            And I'll regret it if I didn't say
            This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)
        </p>

        <p>
            Reaching your limit
            Say you're reaching your limit
            Going over your limit
            But I know you can't quit it
            Something about me
            Got you hooked on my body
            Take you over and under and twisted up like origami
        </p>

        <p>
            Fast nights that got him
            That new life was his problem
            Not saying she was perfect
            Still regrets that moment
            Like that night
            Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
            What a thing to be human (What a thing to be human)
            Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)
